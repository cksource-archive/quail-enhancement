# F91: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 for not correctly marking up table headers

Mentioned in tests: [tableDataShouldHaveTh](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableDataShouldHaveTh.js), [tableWithBothHeadersUseScope](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableWithBothHeadersUseScope.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/F91).

## Problems:

## Room For Improvement:

* `tableDataShouldHaveTh` should not use plain selector, should also use helper function to determine if the table is a data table.
* I would think about adding a new assessment that detect `th` possibly for row without a `[scope=row]` attribute.
	* The only problem is that JAWS seems not to support it well. NVDA is doing slighlty better, but it only supports `scope=col`.
