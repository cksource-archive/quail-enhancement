# F91: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 for not correctly marking up table headers

Mentioned in tests: [tableDataShouldHaveTh](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableDataShouldHaveTh.js), [tableWithBothHeadersUseScope](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableWithBothHeadersUseScope.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/F91).

## Problems:

## Room For Improvement:

* `tableDataShouldHaveTh` should not use plain selector, should also use helper function to determine if the table is a data table.
* I would think about adding a new assessment that detect `th` possibly for row without a `[scope=row]` attribute.
	* The only problem is that JAWS seems not to support it well. NVDA is doing slighlty better, but it only supports `scope=col`.

## Quick Fixes

### `tableWithBothHeadersUseScope`

We might provide a Quick Fix in case of table with both (row and col) headers.

```html
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th><!-- @note: optinally this might be td instead of th -->
		<th>Birth</th>
		<th>Gender</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Clayton</th>
		<td>2005-10-10</td>
		<td>male</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Carol</th>
		<td>2005-10-11</td>
		<td>female</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Susan</th>
		<td>2005-10-12</td>
		<td>female</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Oleg</th>
		<td>2005-10-13</td>
		<td>male</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Belnar</th>
		<td>2005-10-14</td>
		<td>male</td>
	</tr>
	<tr></tr>
</table>
```

Each `th` would gain proper `scope` attribute.
