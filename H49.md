# H49: Using semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text (HTML)

Mentioned in tests: [blockquoteUseForQuotations](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/blockquoteUseForQuotations.js), [blockquoteNotUsedForIndentation](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/blockquoteNotUsedForIndentation.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H49).

## Problems:

* `documentAbbrIsUsed`
	* [Assigning `documentAbbrIsUsed` to H49](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/2)
	* [Better matching](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/1)
	* [Create a Quick Fix](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/3)
	* Provide a better [better integration with AC](https://github.com/cksource/ckeditor-plugin-a11ychecker/issues/119)

## Room For Improvement:

* [`qUseForShortQuotes` / `qElementUsed`](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/4) (**new assessment**)
* [`timeUse`](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/5) (**new assessment**)
* [`citeUseForQuotationSource`](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/6) (**new assessment**)
* [`semanticMarkupForColor`](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/7) (**new assessment**)
* Maybe we could suggest `address` element? Or even better, microformat? Actually I should post this one at SO.
* At some point we might want to bring support for MathML, but [we need understand](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/8) if there's a need for it.
