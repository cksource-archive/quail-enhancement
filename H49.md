# H49: Using semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text (HTML)

Mentioned in tests: [blockquoteUseForQuotations](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/blockquoteUseForQuotations.js), [blockquoteNotUsedForIndentation](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/blockquoteNotUsedForIndentation.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H49).

## Problems:

* I feel like `documentAbbrIsUsed` should be also mapped to `H49` as it's also suggesting sem tags usage.
	* [acronym.js](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/documentAbbrIsUsed.js), so logic used in `documentAbbrIsUsed`.
	* Maybe we can improve acronym finding? I'd love to match abbrs like `GoF`, `DfE`, `PGNiG`.
	* How about accronyms that include number? E.g. `G2G`.
	* Providing a Quick Fix for it would be cool. That Quick Fix would create a text input for each unrecognized abbr.

## Room For Improvement:

* `qUseForShortQuotes` / `qElementUsed` (**new assessment**)
	1. Testability: `1`
	1. Example:
		* [Sweden Government press release](http://www.government.se/sb/d/18308/a/250170)
	1. Implementation:
		1. Find all quote characters and matching close quote (note: limt search to element where quote is open).
		1. If no `<q>` elements were found inside the quote, suggest placing a `q` element.
	1. We might also check lenght of the quote, and if it's too long, then propose placing it should be handled by `blockquoteUseForQuotations`.
	1. Touches also `G115`.
	1. Provide a Quick Fix that would automatically create `q` element with a proper content.
		* Hmm, here we would need to think if we want to leave quote element in text, or not.
* `timeUse` (**new assessment**)
	1. Just an idea: we might look for all sort of date / times and convert them to `<time>` element.
	1. Testability: `1`
	1. Touches also `G115`.
	1. Provide a Quick Fix that would automatically convert date/time representation to a proper `time` element.
* `citeUseForQuotationSource` (**new assessment**)
	1. Testability: `0`
	1. Simply look for all `blockquote` or `q` that does not have a cite in preceding, subsequent element.
	1. This concept has low reliability, so I'm not that much for it.
* Related assessment in [G138](G138.md).
* Maybe we could suggest `address` element? Or even better, microformat? Actually I should post this one at SO.
* @todo: provide a better integration with `documentAbbrIsUsed`. As it passes `info` property, that we might use in a Quick Fix.

### MathML

Note: Check how is `MathML` handled within browsers. If it has a good support we can thing about converting math formulas into MathML

According to [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#feat=mathml) it's currently supported in:

* FF (good implementation)
* Safari (but it's buggy as hell according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML#Web_browsers))

According to some [random MathML article](https://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/tech/MathMLinHTML5.htm) it seems that it might be displayed also in IE6-IE9 with a plugin.

It seems that it's even getting worse. Both Google and Microsoft decides that MathML is no longer worth ther engineers time. So for the time being I think it's not worth to put our focus here.
