# H49: Using semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text (HTML)

Mentioned in tests: [blockquoteUseForQuotations](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/blockquoteUseForQuotations.js), [blockquoteNotUsedForIndentation](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/blockquoteNotUsedForIndentation.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H49).

## Problems:

## Room For Improvement:

* `qUsedForQuotes` / `qElementUsed` (**new assessment**)
	1. Testability: `1`
	1. Example:
		* [Sweden Government press release](http://www.government.se/sb/d/18308/a/250170)
	1. Implementation:
		1. Find all quote characters and matching close quote (note: limt search to element where quote is open).
		1. If no `<q>` elements were found inside the quote, suggest placing a `q` element.
	1. We might also check lenght of the quote, and if it's too long, then propose placing it should be handled by `blockquoteUseForQuotations`.
	1. Touches also `G115`.
	1. Provide a Quick Fix that would automatically create `q` element with a proper content.
		* Hmm, here we would need to think if we want to leave quote element in text, or not.
* `timeUsed` (**new assessment**)
	1. Just an idea: we might look for all sort of date / times and convert them to `<time>` element.
	1. Testability: `1`
	1. Touches also `G115`.
	1. Provide a Quick Fix that would automatically convert date/time representation to a proper `time` element.



Note:
Check how is MathML handled within browsers. If it has a good support we can thing about converting math formulas into MathML
