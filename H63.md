# H63: Using the scope attribute to associate header cells and data cells in data tables (HTML)

Mentioned in tests: [tableUsesScopeForRow](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableUsesScopeForRow.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H63).

## Problems:

* Interesting, at first I thought that we don't support `th[scope]` attribute - but it turns out that it's automatically handled when creating table headers. But we're missing a way to handle `scope` by hand, this is mentioned in [#10239](http://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10239).

## Room For Improvement:

* `tableUsesScopeForRow` - is doing pretty OK checking, but we should improve the description. Actually we should simply advise end user to transform table cell into `th` element with `scope` attribute.
	* **QuickFix** - We might create a QuickFix for that.
