# H39: Using caption elements to associate data table captions with data tables (HTML)

Mentioned in tests: [tableComplexHasSummary](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableComplexHasSummary.js), [tableUsesCaption](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableUsesCaption.js), [tableCaptionIdentifiesTable](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tableCaptionIdentifiesTable.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H39).

## Problems:

* `tableComplexHasSummary`:
	* Is more like for [H73](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H73.html).
	* Descr &quot;If a table is complex (**for example, has some cells with &quot;colspan&quot; attributes**, the table should have a summary.&quot; - it's not a good rationale.
	* Also current description contains unmatched parenthesis (both for en and nl).

## Room For Improvement:

* `tableUsesCaption` should not highlight layout tables. We can use a helper method to determine that. (Not useful for CKE)
* `tableUsesCaption` well it's not like all tables needs caption. H39 tells you to ensure if the caption is visible in presentation, if so then make sure it's `caption` element. I would simply reduce testability to `0.5`.
* **This Technique should also be assigned to**: `tableLayoutHasNoCaption`
	> Note: Although WCAG 2.0 does not prohibit the use of layout tables, CSS-based layouts are recommended in order to retain the defined semantic meaning of the HTML and XHTML table elements and to conform to the coding practice of separating presentation from content. If a table is used for layout, the caption element is not used. The purpose of a layout table is simply to control the placement of content; the table itself is â€œtransparent" to the user. A caption would "break" this transparency by calling attention to the table. See F46: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using th elements, caption elements, or non-empty summary attributes in layout tables for details..
* `tableSummaryDiffersFromCaption` (**new assessment**)
	1. Rationale: "If both are used, the summary should not duplicate information in the caption."
	1. Testability: `1`
	1. Implementation:
		1. find all `table[summary] > caption` (CSS2 compilant selector rather than jQuery)
		1. Get parent table, and test summary vs caption text content. If they're same, report an error.
	1. Note that `summary` became obsolete in HTML5, but still this might be a common case.
