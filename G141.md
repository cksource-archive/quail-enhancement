# G141: Organizing a page using headings

Mentioned in tests: [pNotUsedAsHeader](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/pNotUsedAsHeader.js), [headersUseToMarkSections](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/headersUseToMarkSections.js), [headersHaveText](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/headersHaveText.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/G141).

## Problems:

* `pNotUsedAsHeader` problems issued in [cksource/quail#1](https://github.com/cksource/quail/issues/1).
* `headersUseToMarkSections` - I don't get part that [checkes paragraphs](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/headersUseToMarkSections.js#L2-16). It seems to be unrelated to the purpose of the test.
* `headersUseToMarkSections` is kind of weak. It should also consider all the [Sectioning content](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#sectioning-content-0) mentioned in html5, that is:
	* `article`
	* `aside`
	* `nav`
	* `section`

## Room For Improvement:

* I'm missing a test where we would check that header levels are subsequent, so e.g. one can not use `h2` and `h6` after each other.
* How about a test that would check that at least one header exists?
