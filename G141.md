# G141: Organizing a page using headings

Mentioned in tests: [pNotUsedAsHeader](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/pNotUsedAsHeader.js), [headersUseToMarkSections](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/headersUseToMarkSections.js), [headersHaveText](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/headersHaveText.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/G141).

## Problems:

* `pNotUsedAsHeader` problems issued in [cksource/quail#1](https://github.com/cksource/quail/issues/1).
* `headersUseToMarkSections` - I don't get part that [checkes paragraphs](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/headersUseToMarkSections.js#L2-16). It seems to be unrelated to the purpose of the test.
* `headersUseToMarkSections` is kind of weak. It should also consider all the [Sectioning content](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#sectioning-content-0) mentioned in html5, that is:
	* `article`
	* `aside`
	* `nav`
	* `section`

## Room For Improvement:

* How about a test that would check if at least one header exists?
* `headerNumberingAreConsistent` (**new assessment**)
	1. Ideally I would call it `consistentHeaderNumbering`, but Quail already have common pattern that HTML elmeent name occurs first.
	1. Rationale:

		> authors should use headings that are properly nested (e.g., h1 followed by h2, h2 followed by h2 or h3, h3 followed by h3 or h4, etc.).

	1. Testability: `1`
	1. Implementation: <abbr title="To Be Determined">TBD</abbr>
	1. We might provide a Quick Fix to that, that would automatically adjust heading levels.
