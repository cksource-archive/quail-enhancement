# H48: Using ol, ul and dl for lists or groups of links (HTML)

Mentioned in tests: [definitionListsAreUsed](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/definitionListsAreUsed.js), [documentVisualListsAreMarkedUp](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/documentVisualListsAreMarkedUp.js), [listOfLinksUseList](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/listOfLinksUseList.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H48).

## Problems:

## Room For Improvement:

* `useSemanticLists` (**new assessment**)
	1. Rationale: In CKE we're working with HTML, so we should prefer semantic markup over plain text. Sometimes end-users tries to mimic list a with plain text.
	1. Example:
		* [Warsaw Municipalities](http://bezpieczna.um.warszawa.pl/zarzadzanie-kryzysowe?utm_source=um&utm_medium=www&utm_campaign=top-menu#) - See how "1) kierowanie monitorowaniem" is used as a plain text.
	1. Testability: `0.5`
	1. Implementation:
		1. Find all sectioning elements (or paragraph or whatever).
		1. Get its `innerText` (or textContent in FF, but then it does not convert br to new line)
		1. Perform a regexp that will look for patterns like: `1) foo \n+ 2, bar`
	1. Provide a Quick Fix that would convert it into an (un)ordered list.
	1. We would neet to take care of both ordered, and unordered lists.
	1. This is somehow covered by the `documentVisualListsAreMarkedUp`, so we might think about improving it instead.
* `listOfLinksUseList`
	1. I don't like the way it returns errors. It reports erros for every `a` elem, except for the last one. It would be good to reduce it only to one occurence.
	1. It might be broken if the links are separated by an element, rather by just text nodes. We might change that.
	1. We might add some more characters to the `unreadableText` regexp, like `&raquo;`. `&gt;`, `&dash;`, `&mdash;`, `&vert;`.
* `documentVisualListsAreMarkedUp`
	1. Has a poor regexp used. See [tests fail](https://github.com/cksource/quail/tree/testsFail/documentVisualListsAreMarkedUp) demo branch.
