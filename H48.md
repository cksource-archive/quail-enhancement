# H48: Using ol, ul and dl for lists or groups of links (HTML)

Mentioned in tests: [definitionListsAreUsed](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/definitionListsAreUsed.js), [documentVisualListsAreMarkedUp](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/documentVisualListsAreMarkedUp.js), [listOfLinksUseList](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/listOfLinksUseList.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/H48).

## Problems:

## Room For Improvement:

* [`useSemanticLists`](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/9) (**new assessment**)
* [`listOfLinksUseList`](https://github.com/cksource/quail-enhancement/issues/10) enhancements
* `definitionListsAreUsed`
	* To include it we'd need `dl,dt,dd` in our ACF (ofc customer can do it by himself).
	* Interesting cases:
		* [French diplomacy in Ukraine conflict](http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/ukraine/situation-in-ukraine-what-is/).
		<br>Look at section "A method: firmness and dialogue". You can see it defines two strategies: Firmness and Dialogue. These might be used within `dl` element.
			* This case might look like hard to test. But we can strip following pattern: `\s*<img alt="">\s*(...)` so we would ignore **decorative** images, and then see if there is a strong/bold whatever followed with text.
		* [Official France website](http://www.france.fr/en/gastronomy/large-family-french-cheeses.html) - Quail already handles this test **correctly**!
		<br>Look at both "Pressed cheeses" and "Soft cheeses".
