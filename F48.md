# F48: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using the pre element to markup tabular information

Mentioned in tests: [tabularDataIsInTable](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/tabularDataIsInTable.js), [preShouldNotBeUsedForTabularLayout](https://github.com/quailjs/quail/blob/2.2.15/src/js/custom/preShouldNotBeUsedForTabularLayout.js)

WCAG 2 [overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20150226/F48).

## Problems:

* **Careful:** `tabularDataIsInTable` and `preShouldNotBeUsedForTabularLayout` are pretty similar.
* `tabularDataIsInTable` - Suuuper weak test, looks for `\t` char in `pre`, and if found reports a failure. Remember that `\t` is very common in `pre`, because this element is all about whitespaces.
* `preShouldNotBeUsedForTabularLayout` - Test is pretty naive, it'll render code listings invalid since they often times contain tabs. See [preShouldNotBeUsedForTabularLayout extra tests branch](https://github.com/cksource/quail/tree/testsFail/preShouldNotBeUsedForTabularLayout).

## Room For Improvement:

* `preShouldNotBeUsedForTabularLayout` - Strip leading and trailing whitespace, before spliting parts. This will at least work for code (for the most part).
